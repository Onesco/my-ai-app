Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Key Components:
1. Input Layer - Receives the initial data
2. Hidden Layers - Process information through weighted connections
3. Output Layer - Produces the final result

Types of Neural Networks:
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Transformers

Applications:
Neural networks are widely used in image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis.

Learning Process:
Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, adjusting weights to minimize error between predicted and actual outputs.
